Containerized infrastructure also makes scanning network traffic for security threats more challenging. 
Containers deployed on multiple hosts typically communicate over a virtual, encrypted network, and they are assigned dynamic IP addresses that change continuously as applications are scaled and load balanced by the orchestrator. 
Detecting network traffic anomalies in such an environment requires specialized, application-aware network filtering tools.

----
A container running as privileged essentially disables the security mechanisms provided by Docker and allows 
code to run on the underlying system. 
So whenever possible, avoid allowing any parts of your cluster to run with this setting.
